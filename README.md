## Running The Code

All the code is in the cell_segmentation.ipynb notebook.

Please use pip to install from the requirements file and [download the data](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC020)

In a README, describe a deep learning approach that you would adopt for such task using pseudo code as well as the tools that you would potentially use.

○ Can we track model/data changes? (is the code and data versioned) ○ Where do these jobs get executed? (locally, in the cloud) ○ How automated is the pipeline? (orchestration tools, CI/CD)

There are some extra tips for you down below:

● Please don’t spend more than 3 hrs on this task. We are not looking for the perfect solution but the way how you approach problems. Please feel free to add your thoughts on potential improvement in the README.

● Think about best engineering practice when you prepare the solution (for example code refactoring and productionisation etc.)
